# ReDeX: Water Purification Measurements

## Introduction

This repository contains a public archive of electronics, firmware and software developed as part of the project [ReDeX](https://www.h-brs.de/de/entwicklung-einer-reduktiven-behandlungsmethode-zur-entfernung-von-desinfektionsnebenprodukten-und) that was conducted at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences from 2019 to 2022.

The goal of this sub-project was to develop a sensor network allowing various parameters inside a water purification system to be monitored and analyzed in order to gain a better understanding of the chemical and physical processes involved.

The system is composed of sensor nodes which can be used either as standalone devices connected to a PC over USB or as a sensor network accessed over TCP/IP via a central hub. Every sensor provides complete galvanic isolation in order to prevent any possibility of cross-currents which could potentially invalidate measurements.

The parameters that can be measured include conductance, pH/ORP levels and temperature. In addition a potentiostat for cyclic voltammetry was developed, providing a compliance voltage of Â±4 V and a dynamic range of approx. 1 pA to 10 mA.

Every sensor node has a corresponding user software providing a GUI for individual measurements. The complete sensor network can be accessed via the central hub by means of a shared library with optional LabVIEW integration.
